# Graphiql4all

Graphiql, the in-browser IDE for working with GraphQL APIs, available for any GraphQL endpoint.

## Query params

To use, just set query parameters that specify the GraphQL endpoint and username, and password (for setting Basic Auth headers):

`graphqlEndpoint` -
`graphqlUser` -
`graphqlPassword` - 

For example: /index.html?graphqlEndpoint=http%3A%2F%2Fgraphql.communitygraph.org%2Fgraphql%2F&graphqlUser=graphql&graphqlPassword=graphql
